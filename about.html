				<h4>Goal & Motivations</h4>
				<p>
					The goal of this project is to examine venture funding around the globe
					within 10 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					We chose a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources" target="_blank">
					<strong>Startup Venture Funding dataset, </strong> </a>from Tableau
					Public, which contains information about startup companies, rounds,
					investments, and acquisitions. Firms need financial backing for many
					different reasons such as starting a business and paying for new equipment.
					Venture Capital financing has helped some of the world's most successful
					companies to grow and play an increasingly important role in the economy.
					Therefore, from doing this project, we hope to learn more about multiple
					trends of venture funding among different categories in the 10 year
					timeline
					within interactive visualization.

				<h4>Design & Interactive</h4>
				<p>
					We decided to include three visualizations, interactive bar chart, stacked
					area chart, and line chart. We wanted to leave plenty of room for
					interaction for the users. Our design rationale is as follows:
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							<ul>
								<h5>BAR CHART</h5>
								<li>
									The bars show the top 10 respective count of funding rounds for every
									selection chosen by the user.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user can choose between different company regions, market types,
									and
									countries to see the different counts of investment rounds.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the user is interested in a particular year, the user can have the
									slider to set the years to show specific data.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user can see specific information about the selection by hovering
									over to each bars.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<p>
							<ul>
								<h5>STACKED AREA CHART</h5>
								<li>
									The areas show the top 10 respective amount (USD) of investments over
									time for every selection chosen by the user.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user can select the company region or market type and look at the
									respective investments over time.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the user is interested in particular attribute, the user can hover
									over to each legend. The user can also visualize the attribute by
									clicking the area or the legend.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the user is interested in specific time period, the user can zoom in
									by dragging the chart from the start time to the end.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="column">
						<p>
							<ul>
								<h5>LINE CHART</h5>
								<li>
									The animated lines display information as a series of data points which
									represent the aggregated number of the funding round types of each
									year.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user is able to check and uncheck specific funding round types.
								</li>
								<li>
									The user can see specific information about the funding round types by
									hovering over to each point.
								</li>
							</ul>

				<h4>Takeaways & Drawbacks</h4>
				<p>
					Before constructing the code, we tried sketching the design of the
					visualization to have a proper framework in mind. This vastly helped us
					during the development process, as we were able to go back and refer back
					to the set structure.
				</p>
				<p>
					This dataset allowed us to explore the trends of venture funding in
					different categories, and it was interesting to see different market types,
					regions, and countries invested or raised funding rounds throughout the
					time. It was also interesting to find out the trend of funding and
					investing on different market types or funding round types.
				</p>
				<p>
					The biggest struggle of this project was the pre-processing of the dataset.
					There were too many data points in the dataset, so we divided the file into
					multiple csv files and edited them to obtain the information we needed.
					Since there were too many of them, we struggled to show how much of the
					data to the users. After much thought, we decided to show the top 10
					selections within 10 years.
				</p>


				<p class='tab'>The workload distribution among the team members was pretty
					even. We worked together on brainstorming the big picture framework and
					helped each other while working separately on different parts.
